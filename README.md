# HTML PROGRESS

HTML tutorials

This is to keep track of my HTML progress.

There will be multiple html files here. Each one should be a new part of html that I am learning.

Eventually, I should be creating projects and naming each one accordingly.

The goal is to incorporate HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This is the text editor. I want to find out if commiting means changes to this actual file or simply in the git 'screenshot'.
